first we init the the fractal with mlx functios 
first   mlx_init() what is do ?
         - it initialization for the mlx graphic library and return in pointer, 
         exactly it will establish a connection to the correct graphical system and will return a void *


secondly we call the function 
        mlx_new_window():
         - to open for us in window and return in pointer
         which will return a pointer to the window we have just created. We can give the window height, width and a title.

and we creat in image with the function 
        mlx_new_image()
         to creat in image in the window to work on it 
         This is the recommended way to buffer the image you are rendering. It will accept a 
        pointer to your MLX instance and requires a width and height. Will return a reference pointer to the image.
after that we creat in pointer to hold the data from the the image that we open to localse the pexil
        mlx_get_data_addr()
         - all of that are by 
    

so right now we have our data that we  do work on it and the needed pointers and things so we are ready to star drawign with our mathimatiques formula

the main ormula is Zn+1 = Zn2 + c
    where we represent every element with 
first in the helper funcltion we initialize the varibiles like the inter that he reresent the iteraiiton that 
we will pass to the programe and  it start with and finish with the max iterations
